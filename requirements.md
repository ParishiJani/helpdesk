# $$Software\ Engineering\ and\ Agile$$

## Basic Requirements

- Focused on a topic that is relevant to your job role and/or company.
- Features a small database (minimum of two tables and maximum of four tables).
- Use SQLite, MySQL, Postgres or SQL Server.
- For testing purposes, each table in the final database should contain (at least) 10 records.
- A variety of relevant data types should be included in table columns (including primary and foreign keys).
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to show the defined entities, their attributes, and relationships between the tables.
- The web application should have two types of users/roles – admin, and regular.
- Both the users must register and login in order to use the web application.
- Users should be able to explore records from all the database tables.
- Admin users should have the ability to perform all CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the database tables and make changes to the underlying database data.
- Regular users should have the ability to perform create, read and update operations only.
- Validation should be implemented so that the user cannot conduct an invalid operation orenter data that is not in compliance with the field's requirements.
- When validation rules are broken, appropriate error messages should be displayed.
- The web application should follow the core design rules of modularisation by breaking down the functionality into relevant components.
- The source code of the web application should incorporate features that will improve the code quality and readability by applying basic programming rules such as appropriate naming conventions, indentation, comments, and refactoring.
- After completing an activity, the user should be presented with an appropriate notification indicating whether their activity was successful or not. Also, before exiting the application or deleting a record, a confirmation should be presented to the user.

## Task 1 - Web Application Development

> Artefact counts as an equivalent of 1500 words

Use the Python programming language and an appropriate framework, IDE, and DBMS to build and test a web application based on an agile software development approach that satisfies the criteria detailed in the requirements and guidelines section above.

### Evidence Required

- A summary/explanation of the application and any dependencies (This could be included in a read me text document).
- At least one of the following:

  - A URL to an online source control repository such as GitHub.
  - A zip file of all coding artefacts, including the database.
  - MS Word file containing the source code for all coding artefacts as text (copy/paste), plus screenshots of the running application used to perform activity in the application. (dont do this one)

- A running web application hosted on a free public cloud platform such as Heroku, AWS or Azure (or hosted locally if this is not possible – with video evidence).

## Task 2 - Report on Web Application

> Suggested 500 words

Explain the elements you used based on an agile framework in the development of your web application (even if not actually used). Explain what each of the elements does, how you may have used it and where possible provide evidence of its use in your web application development.

### Evidence Required

- A brief explanation of the web development project and artefacts.
- Evidence of artefacts used (indicate the option chosen to submit the source code).

## Task 3 - Report on Agile Overview

> Suggested 1000 words

### What?

Select a framework of Agile software development approach that is of interest to you and your organization in relation to various aspects such as:

- Running IT/software development projects
- Running IT/software development teams (including roles and responsibilities of team members)
- Measuring IT/software development operations and tasks
- Automating IT/software development operations and tasks.

### How?

- Compare, contrast, and critically evaluate the chosen framework against other Agile software development framework such as Scrum, Kanban and Lean.
- Ensure that you cover all the important features of agile project development principles that relates to the framework you have chosen.
- Propose an improvement to the chosen agile development approach in a way that would benefit your organisation.
- Suggest ways of implementing your proposed improvement.

## Academic Conventions

> **NOTE** This section also analyses your code, not just your write up.

### Requirements

- Your application code and related artefacts should follow secure programming practices such as naming conventions, indentation, comments, and refactoring.
- Screenshots and messages should be well-designed, with consistent formatting.
- The supporting documentation and report should be properly presented as well, with consistent formatting, diagrams, and screenshots as needed, as well as correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

#### The usual stuff

- A fully completed Cover Sheet including correct word count - See Appendix A
- A Table of Contents
- A Bibliography/list of any references that were cited in your report. Relevant references should be cited and formatted using the "Cite them right” referencing guide available via the virtual library.
- A bibliography/list of any references cited in the code should be included with your website code. Relevant code references should be cited and formatted using the "Cite them right” referencing guide available via the virtual library.
